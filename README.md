# Darta

Darta parses Dart source code through ANTLR and renders Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams as single-file HTML pages. The architecture is DDD-inspired with hexagonal boundaries so the ANTLR infrastructure stays behind ports and the domain layer stays independent.

## Step Backlog

- [x] Render Dart 3 `switch expression` as a first-class step in standalone, `return`, and assignment/declaration forms.
- [x] Lift `return await` and other expression-contained `await` forms into explicit await steps instead of plain `return` / `action` labels.
- [ ] Replace the `local function ...` placeholder action with a dedicated local-function step or an inline nested-body rendering mode.
- [ ] Recognize arrow-body `=> expr` functions through semantic steps like `throw`, `await`, `switch`, and `return`.
- [ ] Model plain local variable declarations as dedicated declaration steps instead of generic actions.
- [ ] Preserve statement labels and standalone block statements as structural steps.
- [ ] Differentiate constructor initializer forms like `super(...)` from generic action labels.

**Basic control flow** — sequential actions and an if-block with Yes/No branches:

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

2. Generate the Dart parser from the vendored grammar:

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_dart_parser.py
```

3. Build a Nassi-Shneiderman diagram for one Dart file:

```bash
uv run darta nassi-file path/to/file.dart --out output/file.nassi.html
```

4. Build diagrams for an entire directory:

```bash
uv run darta nassi-dir path/to/project --out output/nassi-bundle
```

5. Parse a file and get a JSON structural report:

```bash
uv run darta parse-file path/to/file.dart
```

See `examples/feature_tour.dart` for a single file that exercises the main control-flow constructs and representative structural extraction edges.

## Architecture

Four explicit layers:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `domain` | model, invariants, ports, domain events |
| `application` | use cases, DTOs |
| `infrastructure` | ANTLR adapter, filesystem, event publishing |
| `presentation` | CLI |
